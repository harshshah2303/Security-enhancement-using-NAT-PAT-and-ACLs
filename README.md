# Security-enhancement-using-NAT-PAT-and-ACLs

Created a virtual network consisting of a DNS server and Web server and enhanced the security performance
of the network by network filtering and configuring ACL to allow only authorized users to access the
servers and denied the traffic from other networks.
Configured NAT and PAT on cisco routers for security improvements by reducing the use of IP addresses.
